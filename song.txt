You know it's crazy, 'cause nights like this
Would start out with a little private party
You sneak me in your mom's house
I know I mighta spilled my drink, but
Really wasn't tryin' to spill my heart out
I mean it started as a conversation
I was really tryin' to get my thoughts out
But then we make moves and we make plans
Had the whole thing mapped out
See, you were gonna go to college
And to pay for bills I'd figure the job out
And you knew I had to say it, but them day's gone
Now I moved on and you switched phones
Hopefully reincarnation will bring us back to the place we belong

Summer after high school when we first met
We make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my 18th birthday we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day, I'd be losing you

In another life
I would be your girl
We keep all our promises
Be us against the world
